# SimpleServer
This is a simple ExpressJS server that bridges AWS based Alexa Skill and LG WebOS TV in my living room.

The package does not work end-to-end out-of the box. It requires an AWS Lambda based Alexa skill and a
workaround in NPM LGTV package for first time use. Will provide more information on this in the future.
