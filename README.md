# SimpleServer
This is a simple ExpressJS server that bridges AWS based Alexa Skill and LG WebOS TV in my living room.

The package does not work end-to-end out-of the box. It requires an AWS Lambda based Alexa Skill, [MyLGSmartTV]
(https://github.com/lohzhang/MyLGSmartTV) and a workaround in NPM LGTV package for first time use.
